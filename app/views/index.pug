          p.intro My name is Phil Manijak. After three years of devoting my 
           | life to the people of Corvallis, Oregon and its communities, 
           | our time together is at a crossroads.

          p Below are a few examples of what I have brought to Corvallis, 
           | and wish to continue working on, with your support.

        .col-sm-offset-4.col-sm-8
          h3 Community swing dancing
          p The Corvallis Swing Dance Society is an organization I 
           | co-founded in 2010 to share my favorite hobby, swing dancing,
           | with the Corvallis area. 

          .row
            .col-sm-6
              img(src="img/january-dance.png" width="100%")
            .col-sm-6
              p Now in its sixth year, this all-volunteer group of 
               | more than 20 people supports local musicians
               | and brings a joyous quality of life to Corvallis.

              p To read more about Corvallis Swing and its upcoming 
               | events, please visit <a href="http://corvallisswing.com">corvallisswing.com</a>.

        .col-sm-offset-4.col-sm-8.section.code-corvallis
            h3 Code Corvallis

            p Code Corvallis is a meetup for people who are 
             | excited about computer programming. Since its 
             | beginnings in 2014, it has become a favorite 
             | for people on small teams looking to connect 
             | with a larger tech. community.

            .row
              .col-sm-6
                p Meetings are free and open to the public. After 
                 | two years of casual meetings in pubs and caf√©s, 
                 | we are on our way toward adding seminars to 
                 | our schedule. 

                p For more information on Code Corvallis, 
                 | consider joining the 
                 | <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Code-Corvallis/">group on Meetup</a>.

        .col-sm-offset-4.col-sm-8
          h3 Swing dance instruction

          p Red Star Dance Studios is a collaboration of 
           | swing dance instructors that bring premier social 
           | dance classes to the greater Corvallis area, with 
           | a focus on Lindy hop, the original swing dance.

            .col-sm-6
              img(src="img/red-star-cards.png" width="100%")

            .col-sm-6
              p Red Star is a for-profit enterprise that has a lot 
               | of local potential &mdash; it has been the most financially 
               | successful of all these projects, and has the clearest 
               | business model.

              p The Red Star website is at <a href="http://lindyhoppers.co">lindyhoppers.co</a>.

          h3 Community apps

          p The Corvallis Arts Walk app, available for free on 
           | <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.holmwell.corvallis_arts_walk&hl=en">Google Play</a> and the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/corvallis-arts-walk/id1028923377?mt=8">Apple App Store</a>, is a great example 
           | of the little things that a software developer can 
           | bring to a community. 

          .row
            .col-sm-6
              img(src="/img/arts-walk-app.png" width="100%")
            .col-sm-6
              p The technology created for the arts walk can be 
               | applied to other groups and organizations in Corvallis, 
               | and, with a little bit of effort, help more-distant organizations 
               | around the world. 

          h3 Grassroots organizing

          p Using the lessons learned 
           | managing Corvallis Swing and professional software projects, 
           | <a href="https://circleblvd.org">Circle Blvd</a> is a project management 
           | tool for local community organizers. 

          p The product of two years of development, it is perfect for 
           | local groups to get things done at the grassroots level. 

          p Circle Blvd is in its infancy, with a few initial customers, 
           | including Corvallis Swing, the Portland 
           | Lindy Society, Thompson &amp; Urey Resources for Nonprofits, Smith  
           | &amp; Williamson, and the OSU Advantage Accelerator. 

          p If this campaign is a success, I will work directly with more 
           | Corvallis groups and organizations to share both the benefits 
           | of Circle Blvd and tailor it to meet their specific needs.

          h3 Combining it all under Holmwell

          p <a href="http://holmwell.com">Holmwell Software</a> looks at the broader picture, and has the 
           | most potential of all my efforts. Holmwell is behind the 
           | technology of Corvallis Swing, Code Corvallis, Red Star Dance 
           | Studios, the Corvallis Arts Walk app, and Circle Blvd.

          .row
            .col-sm-5
              p Small communities have specific needs, and they are 
               | often different 
               | from those of large corporations. Holmwell's goal is 
               | to help grassroots efforts turn into organizations. 
            .col-sm-7

          h3 Goals

          p I am asking for your financial support, in the form of 
           | monthly contributions.

          p My fundraising goal is $1,500 per month. At this level of 
           | funding, I will be able to cover my living expenses, work in 
           | a productive environment on the above projects, and make ends meet with the help
           | of additional income through Red Star Dance Studios and occasional 
           | freelance software work.

          p Note, if the fundraising goal is not met, nobody's cards 
           | will be charged. The deadline is June 1. 

          p Thank you.
