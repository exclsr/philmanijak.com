          p.intro Hello!

          p Welcome to my fundraising campaign, in which I beg for your 
           | money. Nobody likes fundraising, it's true, and it seems 
           | like every person with a half-baked idea is asking for 
           | money these days, so let's get into why we're even here, 
           | risking reputation and folly. 

          p This fundraising campaign is a bit of a battle royale &ndash; 
           | a competition to see which communities actually want me to 
           | stick around. It's both an opportunity to encourage more  
           | action toward a specific cause, and a way to get me to stop 
           | talking about things nobody cares about. 

          p The communities at hand are: 

          ol
            li The Corvallis Swing Dance Society
            li Code Corvallis
            li Red Star Dance Studios
            li Circle Blvd project management
            li Holmwell Software

          p.intro In case we haven't talked much, which is probably true (sorry!),
           | these are all either businesses or projects that I've started.

          p In this campaign, the Corvallis Swing Dance Society is the 
           | clear favorite to raise the most money. I've worked on 
           | this business as a volunteer for
           | about six years, minus a significant hiatus that we won't get 
           | into here. Anyway, Corvallis Swing easily has over 30 people 
           | who, I think, would at least appreciate if I stayed in Corvallis, 
           | especially if I laid out an exciting, futuristic proposal.

          p However, even if those 30 people contributed $10 per month, that's 
           | only $300, and, while a start, it's not much to live on.

          h3 Holmwell Software

          p The business with the most potential is Holmwell Software. 
           | Holmwell is what we get when we develop technology for the 
           | Corvallis Swing Dance Society and then share it with the 
           | rest of the country.

          p For example, to manage the projects run by the Corvallis Swing 
           | board of directors, I made a website called Circle Blvd. 
           | It's probably the best website of its kind. Anyway, I then 
           | took that website, and made it so other organizations 
           | could make their own accounts.

          p Then, I allowed people to edit the Circle Blvd 
           | program itself, so that their organizations could make 
           | their own copies, specific to their needs 
           | &ndash; it is open-source software, if you're familiar with that 
           | term. This is the basic idea behind Holmwell.

          p Corvallis Swing also has a website for managing documents, 
           | another one for event reservations, and plans to make 
           | a program for managing inventory.

          p The goal of Holmwell is to make these tools available to 
           | organizations around town and beyond &ndash; and this can happen 
           | with community support.

          h3 Why should we care about this?

          p This point is a bit nuanced. I don't know. I don't know 
           | why people care or don't care about any of this. I can say 
           | that I care about it, and I've been 
           | told our larger situation is both hopeless and my generation's 
           | problem to fix, so here is a decentralized solution that 
           | I think can work for a lot of people. 

          p I have 14 years experience 
           | making software and about eight years experience organizing 
           | communities &ndash; and people say I am good at these things 
           | &ndash; here it is if you want to help make it happen. 

          p My name is Phil Manijak, and below is an outline of the 
           | communities who I'm asking for support, if you'd like 
           | to read about everyone.

        .col-sm-offset-4.col-sm-8
          h3 Community swing dancing
          p The Corvallis Swing Dance Society is an organization I 
           | co-founded in 2010 to share my favorite hobby, swing dancing,
           | with the Corvallis area. 

          .row
            .col-sm-6
              img(src="img/january-dance.png" width="100%")
            .col-sm-6
              p Now in its sixth year, this all-volunteer group of 
               | more than 20 people supports local musicians
               | and brings a joyous quality of life to Corvallis.

              p To read more about Corvallis Swing and its upcoming 
               | events, please visit <a href="http://corvallisswing.com">corvallisswing.com</a>.

        .col-sm-offset-4.col-sm-8.section.code-corvallis
            h3 Code Corvallis

            p Code Corvallis is a meetup for people who are 
             | excited about computer programming. Since its 
             | beginnings in 2014, it has become a favorite 
             | for people on small teams looking to connect 
             | with a larger tech. community.

            .row
              .col-sm-6
                p Meetings are free and open to the public. After 
                 | two years of casual meetings in pubs and caf√©s, 
                 | we are on our way toward adding seminars to 
                 | our schedule. 

                p For more information on Code Corvallis, 
                 | consider joining the 
                 | <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Code-Corvallis/">group on Meetup</a>.

        .col-sm-offset-4.col-sm-8
          h3 Swing dance instruction

          p Red Star Dance Studios is a collaboration of 
           | swing dance instructors that bring premier social 
           | dance classes to the greater Corvallis area, with 
           | a focus on Lindy hop, the original swing dance. 

          .row
            .col-sm-6
              img(src="img/red-star-cards.png" width="100%")

            .col-sm-6
              p Red Star is a for-profit enterprise that has a lot 
               | of local potential.

              p The Red Star website is at <a href="http://lindyhoppers.co">lindyhoppers.co</a>.

          h3 Community apps

          p The Corvallis Arts Walk app, available for free on 
           | <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.holmwell.corvallis_arts_walk&hl=en">Google Play</a> and the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/corvallis-arts-walk/id1028923377?mt=8">Apple App Store</a>, is a great example 
           | of the little things that Holmwell Software can 
           | bring to a community. 

          .row
            .col-sm-6
              img(src="/img/arts-walk-app.png" width="100%")
            .col-sm-6
              p The technology created for the arts walk can be 
               | applied to other groups and organizations in Corvallis, 
               | and, with a little bit of effort, help more-distant organizations 
               | around the world. 

          h3 Grassroots organizing

          p Using the lessons learned 
           | managing Corvallis Swing and professional software projects, 
           | <a href="https://circleblvd.org">Circle Blvd</a> is a project management 
           | tool for local community organizers. 

          p The product of two years of development, it is perfect for 
           | local groups to get things done at the grassroots level. 

          p Circle Blvd is in its infancy, with a few initial customers, 
           | including Corvallis Swing, the Portland 
           | Lindy Society, Thompson &amp; Urey Resources for Nonprofits, Smith  
           | &amp; Williamson, and the OSU Advantage Accelerator. 

          p If this campaign is a success, I will work directly with more 
           | Corvallis groups and organizations to share both the benefits 
           | of Circle Blvd and tailor it to meet their specific needs.

          h3 Combining it all under Holmwell

          p <a href="http://holmwell.com">Holmwell Software</a> looks at the broader picture, and is behind the 
           | technology of Corvallis Swing, Code Corvallis, Red Star Dance 
           | Studios, the Corvallis Arts Walk app, and Circle Blvd.

          .row
            .col-sm-5
              p Small communities have specific needs, and they are 
               | often different 
               | from those of large corporations. Holmwell's goal is 
               | to help grassroots efforts turn into organizations. 
            .col-sm-7
              img(src="/img/talk-holmwell.png" width="100%")


          h3 Goals

          p I am asking for your financial support, in the form of 
           | monthly contributions.

          p My fundraising goal is $1,500 per month. At this level of 
           | funding, I will be able to cover my living expenses, work in 
           | a productive environment on the above projects, and make ends meet with the help
           | of additional income through Red Star Dance Studios and occasional 
           | freelance software work.

          p Note, if the fundraising goal is not met, nobody's cards 
           | will be charged. The deadline is June 1. 

          p Thank you.
