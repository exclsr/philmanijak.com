          p.intro Hello!

          p My name is Phil Manijak, and I'm a dance instructor, 
           | software engineer, and community organizer in Corvallis, 
           | Oregon.

          p This is a membership drive &ndash; a way to ask the communities 
           | I'm a part of if they'd like me to continue working for them. 
           | If enough people join, I get to stay in Corvallis and 
           | work for you good people, and if not then it's time to 
           | move on.

          p The communities at hand are: 

          ol
            li The Corvallis Swing Dance Society
            li Code Corvallis
            li Red Star Dance Studios
            li Circle Blvd project management
            li Holmwell Software

          p.intro In case we haven't talked much, which is probably true (sorry!),
           | these are all either businesses or projects that I've started, and 
           | I've been working full-time on them for about three years, without 
           | any pay, except for Red Star, which earns a small amount.

          p We have an opportunity in Corvallis to do a lot of things, and 
           | here are five options to help our town flourish. Let me know 
           | which one 
           | you like the best. Since most people are unfamiliar with 
           | Holmwell, and I think it's the coolest, here's a short overview.  
 
          h3 Holmwell Software

          p Holmwell is what we get when we develop technology for the 
           | Corvallis Swing Dance Society and then share it with the 
           | rest of the country.

          p For example, to manage the projects run by the Corvallis Swing 
           | board of directors, I made a website called Circle Blvd. 
           | It's probably the best website of its kind. Anyway, I then 
           | took that website, and made it so other organizations 
           | could make their own accounts.

          p Then, I allowed people to edit the Circle Blvd 
           | program itself, so that their organizations could make 
           | their own copies, specific to their needs 
           | &ndash; it is open-source software, if you're familiar with that 
           | term. This is the basic idea behind Holmwell.

          p Corvallis Swing also has a website for managing documents, 
           | another one for event reservations, and plans to make 
           | a program for managing inventory.

          p The goal of Holmwell is to make these tools available to 
           | organizations around town and beyond &ndash; and this can happen 
           | with community participation.

          h3 Why should we care about this?

          p This point is a bit nuanced. I don't know. I don't know 
           | why people care or don't care about locally produced, community 
           | backed solutions to broad problems. I am here to offer my work  
           | as a suggestion for something to get behind.

          p I can say 
           | that I think projects like this are what we need to get 
           | out of the larger situation we're in &ndash; that is, in 
           | an economy that unfairly distributes wealth and in an  
           | environment that wants us out of here. 

          p I've been told our situation is both hopeless and my generation's 
           | problem to fix, so here is a decentralized solution that 
           | I think can work for a lot of people. 

          p I have 14 years experience 
           | making software and about eight years experience organizing 
           | communities &ndash; and people say I am good at these things 
           | &ndash; here I am if you want to help make it happen. 

          h3 Rewards

          p There are rewards. Have your name in lights. Get into events 
           | for free. Have influence, clout, attention 
           | and prestige. Get tiny pins. Get early access. Do I 
           | really need to lay out all of the possibilities? 

          p Below is an outline of the 
           | communities I'm asking to join me, if you'd like 
           | to read about everyone.

        .col-sm-offset-4.col-sm-8
          h3 Community swing dancing
          p The Corvallis Swing Dance Society is an organization I 
           | co-founded in 2010 to share my favorite hobby, swing dancing,
           | with the Corvallis area. 

          .row

            .col-sm-6
              p Now in its sixth year, this all-volunteer group of 
               | more than 20 people supports local musicians
               | and brings a joyous quality of life to Corvallis.

        .col-sm-offset-4.col-sm-8.section.code-corvallis
            h3 Code Corvallis

            p Code Corvallis is a meetup for people who are 
             | excited about computer programming. Since its 
             | beginnings in 2014, it has become a favorite 
             | for people on small teams looking to connect 
             | with a larger tech. community.

            .row
              .col-sm-6
                p Meetings are free and open to the public. After 
                 | two years of casual meetings in pubs and caf√©s, 
                 | we are on our way toward adding seminars to 
                 | our schedule. 

                p For more information on Code Corvallis, 
                 | consider joining the

        .col-sm-offset-4.col-sm-8
          h3 Swing dance instruction

          p Red Star Dance Studios is a collaboration of 
           | swing dance instructors that bring premier social 
           | dance classes to the greater Corvallis area, with 
           | a focus on Lindy hop, the original swing dance.

            .col-sm-6
              img(src="img/red-star-cards.png" width="100%")

            .col-sm-6
              p Red Star is a for-profit enterprise that has a lot 
               | of local potential.

              p The Red Star website is at <a href="http://lindyhoppers.co">lindyhoppers.co</a>.

          h3 Community apps

          p The Corvallis Arts Walk app, available for free on 
           | <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.holmwell.corvallis_arts_walk&hl=en">Google Play</a> and the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/corvallis-arts-walk/id1028923377?mt=8">Apple App Store</a>, is a great example 
           | of the little things that Holmwell Software can 
           | bring to a community. 

          .row
            .col-sm-6
              img(src="/img/arts-walk-app.png" width="100%")
            .col-sm-6
              p The technology created for the arts walk can be 
               | applied to other groups and organizations in Corvallis, 
               | and, with a little bit of effort, help more-distant organizations 
               | around the world. 

          h3 Grassroots organizing

          p Using the lessons learned 
           | managing Corvallis Swing and professional software projects, 
           | <a href="https://circleblvd.org">Circle Blvd</a> is a project management 
           | tool for local community organizers. 

          p The product of two years of development, it is perfect for 
           | local groups to get things done at the grassroots level. 

          p Circle Blvd is in its infancy, with a few initial customers, 
           | including Corvallis Swing, the Portland 
           | Lindy Society, Thompson &amp; Urey Resources for Nonprofits, Smith  
           | &amp; Williamson, and the OSU Advantage Accelerator. 

          p If this membership drive is a success, I will work directly with more 
           | Corvallis groups and organizations to share both the benefits 
           | of Circle Blvd and tailor it to meet their specific needs.

          h3 Combining it all under Holmwell

          p <a href="http://holmwell.com">Holmwell Software</a> looks at the broader picture, and is behind the 
           | technology of Corvallis Swing, Code Corvallis, Red Star Dance 
           | Studios, the Corvallis Arts Walk app, and Circle Blvd.

          .row
            .col-sm-5
              p Small communities have specific needs, and they are 
               | often different 
               | from those of large corporations. Holmwell's goal is 
               | to help grassroots efforts turn into organizations. 
            .col-sm-7

          h3 Goals

          p I am asking you to join me in this effort, in the form of 
           | monthly financial contributions.

          p My goal for the membership drive is 150 members, or about 
           | $1,500 per month. At this level of 
           | backing, I will be able to cover my living expenses, work in 
           | a productive environment on the above projects, and make ends 
           | meet with the help
           | of additional income through Red Star Dance Studios and occasional 
           | freelance software work.

          p Note, if the goal of the membership drive is not met, nobody's cards 
           | will be charged. The deadline is June 1. 

          p Thank you for this opportunity, and please contact me at 
           | <a href="mailto:membership@holmwell.com">membership@holmwell.com</a> if you have any questions.
